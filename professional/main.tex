\addblocktext{Summary}{
Seeking an architect or a principal leadership role in the area of networks, protocol and platform research and development.
I have been in the data- and telecommunication industry all through my career and have a track record of accomplishing beyond the project goals. I have successfully collaborated with internal and external partners, arriving at the best possible approach to a problem. Reporting into the OCTO, I have brought several early-stage vision and initiatives to tangible solutions through proof-of-concepts; have driven their strategy, planning and road-maps while continuing to be hands-on.
As a technologist, I deepdive into use case workflows, understand network-specific nuances, and explore ways to resolve them. I have a number of patents, my work is published in both academic and industry standard organizations.
