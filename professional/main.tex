\addblocktext{Summary}{
Seeking an architect or a principal leadership role in the area of network architecture, protocol and platform research, development, standardization.
I have been in the data- and telecommunication industry all through my career and have a track record of accomplishing beyond the project goals. I have successfully collaborated with internal and external partners, arriving at the best possible approaches to a problem. Reporting into the OCTO, I have been part of several early-stage vision and initiatives, and  have driven their strategy, planning and road-maps while continuing to remain hands-on technical.
As a technologist, I seek to understand limitations and complexities in networking and continuously explore ways to resolve them. I have a number of patents, my work is published in both academic and industry standard organizations.
